# samsonrealty-redesign

**Background**
Samson Realty (http://www.samsonrealty.com/) is one of the most widely used realtors on College Hill. As juniors, our housing search was made difficult by the terrible usability of the Samson Website. So, we decided to redesign their interface. In our project, weâ€™ve created six wireframes using usability principles, redesigned two of their webpages, created two annotated mockups, and a sample responsive website for different screen sizes.
